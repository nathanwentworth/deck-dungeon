# boilerplate
a lightweight base that i use for all of my web projects. minimal styles are in place by default, but there's enough to get rid of annoyances and set preferred defaults. this isn't meant to dictate any kind of style (like bootstrap), rather this is just a lighter-weight version of something like [html5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/).
